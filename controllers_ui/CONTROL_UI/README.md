### Getting JSON interfaces into Control ([Getting JSON interfaces into Control](http://charlie-roberts.com/Control/?page_id=47))

The easiest way to load your interfaces into Control is by placing them on a web server where Control can access them. Most operating systems come with a web server built into them. If you enable this web server and place your JSON files into the web server directories you can then access the files by pressing the + button at the top of the Interfaces tab. You’ll then be prompted to enter the URL of your interface file; if you’re on a home wifi network this will look similiar to the following:

```
192.168.1.2/~yourusername/yourInterfaceName.js
```
